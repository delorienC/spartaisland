# SpartaIsland

## 💡 Project Goal
This project was created to explore the possibilities and advantages of **Laravel** and **React**. It serves as a playground for experimenting with different technologies, understanding their functionality, and learning how to integrate them effectively.

## 🌟 Motivation
Since Laravel and React are widely used in modern web applications, I want to take my time to:
- Gain a deep understanding of Laravel as a backend framework.
- Utilize React for frontend development and understand its architecture.
- Optimize the connection between both technologies using RESTful APIs and authentication mechanisms.
- Implement best practices in development and security.

## 🔧 Workflow
- I work iteratively without strict deadlines.
- The project is continuously adjusted and improved.
- Various concepts are tested and discarded if necessary.

## 🌐 Technologies
- **Backend**: Laravel 11 (REST API, authentication with Sanctum, MySQL/MongoDB as a database)
- **Frontend**: React with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI
- **Database**: MySQL for user management, MongoDB for large data sets (e.g., exercises)
- **State Management**: React Query

## 🌟 Future
Over time, the project will gain more structure, polish, and versioning. However, I am taking my time with this process, as it is not my primary focus at the moment.
